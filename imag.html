            An image is a visual representation of something, while a digital image is a binary representation of visual data. <br> These images can take the form of photographs,
            <br> graphics and individual video frames. For this purpose, an
            <br> image is a picture that was created or copied and stored in electronic form.
        </p>

        <p style="font-size: x-large;">An image is a visual representation of something. <br>It can be two-dimensional, three-dimensional, <br>or somehow otherwise feed into the visual system to convey information. An image can be an artifact, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional
            picture,
            <br> that resembles a subject. In the context of signal processing, an image is <br> a distributed amplitude of color </p>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">n optics, the term "image" may refer specifically to a 2D image.
            <br> An image does not have to use the entire visual system to be a visual representation. <br> A popular example of this is of a greyscale image, which uses the visual system's sensitivity to brightness across all wavelengths, without taking
            into account different colors.
            <br>A black and white visual representation of something is still an image, even though it does not make full use of the
            <br> visual system's capabilities. Images are typically still, but in some cases can be moving or animated.</p>
