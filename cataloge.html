        <h1>Cataloging</h1>

        <p>A product catalog is a type of marketing collateral that lists essential product details that help buyers make a purchasing decision. These details include product features, description, dimensions, price, weight, availability, colors, customer
            reviews and more. Our team does premium cataloging by doing market research so that maximum orders can be generated.</p>

        <p>A service catalog contains templates with specifications that define parameters and features of a service (such as bandwidth and speed). Compared to the product catalog, the service catalog describes product features in technical terms.</p>

        <p>Cataloguing and classification represent a continuum in the process of organizing library resources but even though the two are separate processes, one can not do without the other. They save the time of the user that <br>could have been wasted
            in continuous search for documents and they promote effective <br>library services.</p>


        <h1>What is the importance of catalogue design?</h1>
