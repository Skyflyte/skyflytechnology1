                    Companies adopting the business model B2C (business to customer) sell their products or services directly to the consumer. Clothing, books, tickets, market products and so on. Most of the websites we buy from work with this business model. The consumer
                    enters the website, goes through the product catalog, <br> usually sees the photos and details of the product, selects and orders the products he wants.

                    In the B2B (business to business) model, companies sell to companies.
                    <Br> The buyer is either big enough to buy or sell products wholesale or to buy wholesale because of their needs.<br> A famous example of working with the B2B model is alibaba.com.

                    Nonprofessional consumers; may want to sell second-hand phones, houses, cars or other products they do not use. Websites that work with the C2C model serve as intermediaries for consumers to sell to consumers. Generally, they receive a commission, processing
                    fee or advertisement fee from these sales.

                    Consumer to business, or C2B, differs from other e-commerce models because it's the consumers who create value for a product or business. In the traditional business-to-consumer e-commerce model, businesses sell products or services directly to consumers.
                    With C2B, consumers offer products or services to businesses in exchange for payment or other benefits.

        <h2>What are the requirements to set up an eCommerce website?</h2>

        <h1>SaaS eCommerce packages</h1>
        <p>This is a highly preferred “turnkey solution”. You choose a company that offers eCommerce packages, <br>and you subscribe to the company’s most suited package for a certain period of time (usually annually). <br>These packages often include payment
            methods such as hosting, SSL,<br> ready-made design templates, virtual POS. Higher-priced packages may include features such as mobile applications, <br>mobile payment methods, gift voucher system, discounted shipping, marketplace integrations.
        </p>

        <h2>Open source software</h2>
        <p>This solution includes open source software, such as PrestaShop, WooCommerce, OpenCart, Magento.<br> The core of this software is completely free. Plugins and themes that offer additiona<br> l features are sold for a fee. However, <br>in order
            to establish your own eCommerce website with these software,<br> you need to be experienced in web design, site management, virtual POS integration or hire an expert. Because they are open source, they offer <br> more customization. However,
            if you are not a technical expert, it may be difficult for you to install and customize these software by yourself and make it legal.</p>

        <h2> Custom software development</h2>

        <p>If you think that the software does not meet your needs, you can customize the entire infrastructure from scratch, <br>and you can negotiate with a professional web designer.<br> However, remember that such a project will take longer and will
            be costly.</p>

        <h2>Web hosting</h2>
        <p>If you are going to get a ready-made eCommerce software, your package may include hosting services. If not,<br> you will need to choose a hosting plan that fits the needs of your software. <br>GoDaddy’s Business Hosting plans can be the ideal
            option for you.</p>
