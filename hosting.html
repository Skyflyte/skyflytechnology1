        <h1>what is web-hosting</h1>
        <p>Hosting, in its most generic sense, is a service through which storage and computing resources are providing to
            <br>an individual or organization for the accommodation and maintenance of one or more websites and related services.
            <br>While hosting doesnâ€™t need to be IP-based, the vast majority of instances are web-based services that allow a website or web service to be globally accessible from the Internet.

        <p>Web hosting definition: It provides a secure place to store online content. The code, images, videos, <br> and text that comprise a website all have to be stored somewhere.<br> Without a stable digital repository, none of us could consistently
            access content on the web.</p>
