        <h1>What is a domain name?</h1>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">A domain name is a string of text that maps to an alphanumeric IP address, <br> used to access a website from client software. In plain English, a domain name is the text that a
            <br> user types into a browser window to reach a particular website. For instance, the domain name for Google is ‘google.com’.</p>

        <p>The actual address of a website is a complex numerical IP address (e.g. 192.0.2.2), but thanks to DNS, users are able to<br> enter human-friendly domain names and be routed to the websites they are looking for.<br> This process is known as a DNS
            <span>(Domain Name system)</span>lookup.</p>

        <h1>Who manages domain names?</h1>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">Domain names are all managed by domain registries, which delegate the reservation of domain names to registrars.<br> Anyone who wants to create a website can register a domain name with a registrar,<br> and there are currently over 300 million
            registered domain names.</p>

        <h1> What is the difference between a domain name and a URL?</h1>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">A uniform resource locator (URL), sometimes called a web address, contain<br>s the domain name of a site as well as other information, including the protocol and the path. For example, in the URL ‘https://cloudflare.com/learning/’, <br> ‘cloudflare.com’
            is the domain name, while ‘https’ is the protocol and ‘/learning/’ is the path to a specific page on the website.</p>
        <h1>
            What are the parts of a domain name?
        </h1>
        <p style="font-size: x-large;">Domain names are typically broken up into two or three parts, each separated by a dot. When read right-to-left, <br>the identifiers in domain names go from most general to most specific. The section to the right of the last dot in a domain name
            is the top-level domain (TLD). <br>These include the ‘generic’ TLDs such as ‘.com’, ‘.net’, and ‘.org’,<br> as well as country-specific TLDs like ‘.uk’ and ‘.jp’.</p>
        <h3>To the left of the TLD is the second-level domain (2LD) and if there is anything to the left of the 2LD, it is called the third-level domain (3LD). Let’s look at a couple of examples:</h3>

        <h3>.’.com’ is the TLD (most general)</h3>
        <h3>.google’ is the 2LD (most specific)</h3>
        <h3>.’.co’* is the 2LD
        </h3>
        <h3>.’google’ is the 3LD (most specific) (most general)</h3>
